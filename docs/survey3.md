Participants who chose *other* gave the following answers:

- Inspiration and post processing modification
 
- I would use it for inspiration purposes and for modifying in post-generation
 
-  ispiration purpose and modify after generation
 
-  I would use it for specific exercises on rhythm and improvisation based on the generated audio <superscript>*</superscript>
 
- Not at this time because the program does not process music according to my specifications <superscript>*</superscript>
 
- I would use it for inspiration, include it as it is and include it after alteration

<superscript>*</superscript> answers translated 


### Q34) _Do you think giving the opportunity to personalize the text-to-music model with own music is good? Why?_

P1: "I believe that integration of artificial intelligence can give a boost to music production, providing more opportunities for young artists"

P2: "maybe it could be useful in order to save your general signature sound and use it to create new sounds starting from them"

P3: "Yes, it's very good because gives more control on the output and creative use of my samples"

P4: "Yes, it further improves the quality of the model in the task of generating samples from a specific genre. Even if this means that the quality in very different genres is decreased it's not a big deal, as we can still fall back to the original model or even fine-tune it again for a different task."

P5: "I think it has the potential to let musicians get realistic sounds with very little effort, but it could also be a bit risky as it could essentially allow anyone to copy any style in very little time, possibly harming the original creator (e.g. by providing much cheaper copies they can't react to in time)"

P6: "Yes, because that way everyone would create their own style and use it as they see fit<superscript>*</superscript>"

P7: "Is good because it can fit better your own music tastes"

P8: "yes, because it allows the user to draw a line to be followed by the model and to get better results"

P9: "Yes because you can experiment mixing different types of genres listening the resulting output"

P10: "Yes, to satisfy specific needs or discover new sounds, but it needs to be better customizedo<superscript>*</superscript>"

P11: "I think is a good option for the artist to work on a different settings for their wor."

P12: "Yes because it creates a lot of oportunities to the user to create and play with the model. Maybe this would hook the user to use the model more than other models that does not offer this posibility"

P13: "absolutely, because it can provide signature sounds that only belongs to the artists"

P14: "Yes, because music tends to be really different, so a fine tuning is necessary in order to have a result that might be meaningful during the writing process, taking care of specific constraints such as harmony, rythm, etc..."

P15: "Yes, because it can help artists in the composition and editing of musical bases for lyrics<superscript>*</superscript>"

P16: "Yes. The opportunity to personalize the text-to-music model with own music can be an opportunity to find some new alterations in what a musician play, leading to new possibilities of finding new path in the music creation process"

P17: "Not at this moment, because I can't play the requested music<superscript>*</superscript>"

P18: "yes, because the result is more likeable to the user"

P19: "To better tune the model towards a specific genre"

P20: "Yes to generate unique sounds and personalized music"

P21: "Yes since the output would be more likely to match personal taste and give good chances of re-intepreting our own music"

P22: "Yes, because its a good way to make new content to use for new stuff"

P23: "It is a very good idea because it can give the user the possibility to explore the sounds he/she provides in a more creative way"

P24: "I have not used the model personalization, but it could be used in any context in reference to specific needs, e.g. birthday party, music for children, DJ or themed evenings, themed parties, etc...<superscript>*</superscript>"

### Q35) _Insert here your suggestions and comments_ (optional answer)

P3: "The model should have less noisy outputs and more frequencies in the spectrum of the outputs"

P4: "Fine tuning the model greatly increases the quality in the generation of one specific genre, but it also lowers the average quality when generating music from completely different genres."

P5: "DAW integration would be great to have for my use case"

P6: "I enjoyed the interaction and it was very interesting, but it is still a bit immature. I think it has a lot of potential for growth.<superscript>*</superscript>"

P8: "in the future a combination of the model with an interacive process (the user makes a choise between n audio and next generation is conditioned by his/her choise) can be useful"

P9: "Very nice work, I would suggest to try the experiment with others text to music models and compare results to analyze what is the better."

P10: "We should make longer tracks and improve the sound quality, overall it was a new and beautiful experience<superscript>*</superscript>"

P11: "More speed (just a little bit) for the generation of my models."

P13: "only generate one sound at the time and not the whole track, words ambiguity with similar meanings, improve the GUI"

P14: "It's a very nice tool for musicians that might get stuck finding inspiration. Probably it's still a little too complicated for someone without some technical knowledge, so in the future it might be useful to 'guide' the user in some way in order to obtain better results"

P15: "Very pleasant experience, I enjoyed experimenting with this new tool that I had never tried before. Interesting the combinations and searches that the system does for the word-sound association.<superscript>*</superscript>"

P16: "I would add a list of words related to specific areas of music structure, with the corrispective description, to give the user a tool to modify specific aspect of the song in the prompt given to the model"

P17: "My expectation was that the model would be able to generate music following my specific specifications, regardless of the models pre-set inside it. In the specific case, I wanted it to transform the basic electric guitar riff inside it and adapt it to a riff usable with an acoustic guitar.<superscript>*</superscript>"

P18: "Improve the graphical interface by adding color<superscript>*</superscript>"

P22: "improve the quality of sound in terms of sample Hz"

P23: "Create a VST plugin with this application, fix the generation of silence or volume attenuation that sometimes occur"

P24: "The sound should be more relevant and pertinent to my requests given by the text, but overall I found the experiment interesting<superscript>*</superscript>"
